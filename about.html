<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi there, I'm Jake Akkerman! I've always loved learning and helping others learn too. I earned my Elementary Education degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia and later got a graduate degree in Administration & Leadership from the University of Central Missouri. I dream of leading in education someday, making schools awesome places for students and teachers.
 When I'm not busy with school stuff, you can find me enjoying sports. I'm a big fan of both playing and watching games. Football, hockey, and baseball are my favorites. I've even assisted a little league team, which was a blast. Looking ahead, I'm excited to step into a leadership role in education. My goal is to make sure every student gets the best education possible. And who knows, maybe I'll even combine my love for sports with education someday. For now, I'm on a journey to learn, grow, and make a difference in the world of education.</p>
